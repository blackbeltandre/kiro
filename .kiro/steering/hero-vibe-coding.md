# Hero Component Iterative Tuning

Use this steering doc for quick CSS/animation/copy iterations on the Kiroween Hero component.

## Quick Prompts for Kiro Agent

### Animation Timing
"Adjust hero fade-in to 1.2s with ease-in-out"
"Make CTA button hover scale to 1.08 instead of 1.05"
"Add 0.3s delay to metadata row animation"

### Color Tuning
"Change gradient from orange-purple to green-purple for eco theme"
"Increase text contrast by darkening overlay to black/70"
"Make CTA button gradient more vibrant (saturation +20%)"

### Copy A/B Testing
"Generate 5 alternative H1 headlines emphasizing 'AI' and 'Halloween'"
"Rewrite subheadline to focus on prize amount first"
"Create urgent CTA copy variants (scarcity angle)"

### Layout Adjustments
"Move metadata row to top instead of bottom"
"Increase mobile text size by 10%"
"Add more padding around CTA buttons on tablet"

## Vibe Coding Workflow

1. **Identify element** (e.g., "CTA button", "H1 headline")
2. **Describe desired feel** (e.g., "more playful", "urgent", "premium")
3. **Let Kiro suggest** CSS/copy changes
4. **Iterate** with "make it more X" or "try variant B"

## Example Session

```
User: "Make the hero feel more premium and less playful"

Kiro: 
- Change font to serif for H1
- Reduce emoji usage in metadata
- Use gold gradient instead of orange
- Increase letter-spacing on CTA buttons
- Add subtle shadow to text for depth

User: "Apply changes to Variant A only"

Kiro: [makes targeted edits to VariantA component]
```

## Performance Tuning Prompts

"Reduce Spline placeholder animation complexity"
"Defer non-critical CSS to improve FCP"
"Add resource hints for Spline CDN"

## Accessibility Tuning

"Increase focus ring thickness to 3px"
"Add aria-live region for countdown updates"
"Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AAA"
